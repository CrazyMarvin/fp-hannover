*Slot 1: Supabase (@Marvin)*  
[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) calls itself the `Open Source Firebase Alternative`. It offers the following services: [database](https://supabase.com/database), [authentication](https://supabase.com/auth), [storage](https://supabase.com/storage) and [functions](https://supabase.com/edge-functions). The inspiration came from this [song](https://youtu.be/4JipHEz53sU). I will prepare a few slides but the focus is in slot 2 where we will gain hands-on experience with [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase).

*Slot 2: Sneak.Page (@Marvin)*  
In today's session we will try to implement Supabase into [sneak.page](https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/sneak.page). 
By doing so we will get a better understanding of Supbase. I will prepare a tenant so that we can jump right into it.
