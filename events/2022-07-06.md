*Slot 1: Elm compiler (@Fabian)*

We will have a look at the source code of the [elm compiler](https://github.com/elm/compiler).  The goal is to get an idea of its structure and see if we can do little adjustments to change part of Elm's Kernel code.  In particular we will try to give `Cmd`s a `Task`-like API.

*Slot 2: Elm editor (@Michael)*

[Elm Editor](https://github.com/elm-fullstack/elm-fullstack/tree/main/implement/example-apps/elm-editor) is a web-based editor for Elm programs. It helps novice programmers by automating the setup and configuration of the various tools that make up a complete development environment.
We will take a look under the hood and learn how Elm Editor integrates development tools and implements the functionality enhancing our productivity and helping us navigate our projects.
If you want to test-drive Elm Editor in advance, check out the demo at https://elm-editor.com

*Optional Book club: [DATA AND REALITY (W. Kent)](https://www.google.com/search?q=data+and+reality)*
For anyone interested, we are going to discuss the first chapter *1 ENTITIES*.
