title: "Online meetup: Planning 2022"
time: 7:00 PM

Hi,

with our initial session this year, we want to plan a bit what we would like to do.

In this online get-together, we want to bring our ideas and concrete topics for upcoming sessions, so that we can assign topics to the available slots of this year.

Remember, we care about what YOU want to SHOW as well as what YOU want to SEE in particular!

Ideally, we come up with some 15 - 25 topics so that we sketch up a rough program for all of 2022. We will make adjustments as we go, I am sure, but let's have lots of ideas to discuss and prioritize from for this initial planning session.

This would be an opportune time for you to introduce yourself as well, as you can shape the program of this meetup, as well as to let us know what interests you, so that we can accommodate for that.

Topics don't necessarily have to be strictly related only to functional programming. Functional programming is the theme that we want to keep throughout the entire meetup, and not necessarily the theme that every presentation has to conform to.

Looking forward to seeing you all!

The online location (URL) for video conferencing will be announced shortly before the event.
