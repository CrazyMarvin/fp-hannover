*Slot 1: elm-graphql (@Alexander)*

We are going to take a look at how to use [Dillon Kearns' elm-graphql](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/latest/) to generate type-safe code representing a GraphQL-schema.

*Slot 2: atools (@Alexander)*

I am working on a small set of personal, plain-text-based and CLI productivity tools and want to share my latest updates.
