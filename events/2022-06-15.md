[NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) is a generic algorithm for the evolution of artificial neural networks featuring topological crossover, innovation preservation and incremental topology development. We are going to take a cursory look at the key concepts of the algorithm described in the [2002 paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?stanley:ec02).
